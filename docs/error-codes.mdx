title: Error Codes
---

Error codes are a way to standardize error messages across your API. This can be useful for debugging and for providing more information to the client about what went wrong.

You can provide an error code as either just a `string` ID or as a `ErrorCode` object that can contain default options for the error with that code.

## Creating an Error Code

Create an error code that has a default message and status code:

```typescript
import { ErrorCode, SendableError } from "sendable-error";

const CODE_MISSING_REQUIRED = new ErrorCode({
  code: "validation/missing-required",
  defaultMessage: "Missing required field",
  status: 400,
});

throw new SendableError({
  code: CODE_MISSING_REQUIRED,
  details: {
    field: "id",
  },
});
```

## Using a String ID

You can also use a string ID for the error code:

```typescript
throw new SendableError({
  code: "validation/missing-required",
  message: "Missing required field",
  status: 400,
  details: {
    field: "id",
  },
});
```
